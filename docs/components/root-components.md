# Root components

The root `@medram/react-ui-kit` entrypoint is the convenience layer. It mixes a small set of re-exported fields with app-ready components that already encode common dashboard patterns.

Use it when you want fewer imports and the component already matches your workflow.

::: tip Prefer subpaths for focused imports
If you already know you need charts, wizard helpers, primitives, or fields, importing from the dedicated subpath keeps intent clearer.

## Fast examples

### Status messaging with `AlertBox`

```tsx
import { AlertBox } from "@medram/react-ui-kit"

export function BillingNotice() {
  return (
    <AlertBox
      type="warning"
      title="Card expiring soon"
      description="Update the payment method before the next invoice runs."
    />
  )
}
```

### Async forms with `SubmitButton`

```tsx
import { Form, Formik } from "formik"
import { InputField, SubmitButton } from "@medram/react-ui-kit"

export function InviteForm() {
  return (
    <Formik initialValues={{ email: "" }} onSubmit={sendInvite}>
      <Form className="space-y-4">
        <InputField name="email" label="Email" type="email" required />
        <SubmitButton title="Send invite" />
      </Form>
    </Formik>
  )
}
```

### Pagination with page-size control

```tsx
import { Pagination } from "@medram/react-ui-kit"

export function ResultsFooter() {
  return (
    <Pagination
      currentPage={2}
      totalCount={126}
      pageSize={20}
      onPageChange={(page) => console.log(page)}

## How to choose between root helpers and subpaths

- Want the simplest, app-ready component? Start at the root barrel.
- Want low-level composition or stricter import boundaries? Use the dedicated subpath.
- Want predictable form behavior? Prefer `@medram/react-ui-kit/fields`.
- Want a workflow with providers and shared state? See [Workflows and providers](/components/workflows).
